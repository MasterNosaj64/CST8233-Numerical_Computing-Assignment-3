#Numerical Computing - Assignment 3 - CST8233 - Algonquin College - Computer Engineering - Computing Science
Purpose of the assignment

-  Solve 1st order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) using Euler’s and Runge-Kutta 4th Order Methods.
-  Develop a program in C/C++ for computing solutions with Euler’s Method.
-  Modify the program to implement Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method.
-  Calculate relative error of solutions at each time step.
-  Output should include a table showing exact temperature, estimated temperature, and relative error.
-  User can choose the method and step size for solving the ODE.
